# Multiple Staking Pools with Customizable Terms
Allow users to create staking pools with varying lock-in periods (e.g., short-term, medium-term, long-term). Implement different reward mechanisms such as fixed rewards, percentage-based APY, and performance-based rewards. Enable users to define custom minimum and maximum staking amounts for each pool, encouraging both small and large investors.

## Testing Scenarios:
- Create multiple staking pools with different lock-in periods and verify that users can successfully join each pool.
- Ensure the reward mechanism (fixed or APY-based) is calculated correctly for each staking pool.
- Verify that custom minimum and maximum staking amounts are enforced correctly during pool creation and user staking.

# Dynamic Rewards Based on Performance
Offer tiered rewards where higher commitment levels, such as longer staking periods or larger amounts staked, unlock higher rewards.

## Testing Scenarios:
- Stake different amounts and for various durations to check that tiered rewards are applied correctly.
- Test scenarios where users increase their stake mid-way through the staking period to confirm dynamic reward recalculation.
- Validate that users receive accurate rewards based on their commitment level at the end of the staking period.

# Auto-Compounding Rewards
Automatically re-stake the earned rewards to compound the earnings without requiring manual intervention from users.

## Testing Scenarios:
- Stake tokens in a pool and allow rewards to accumulate. Verify that rewards are automatically re-staked.
- Test auto-compounding functionality by tracking balances over multiple reward cycles to ensure correct compounding calculations.
- Ensure that auto-compounding is configurable (optional or mandatory) based on pool rules.

# Penalties and Bonuses for Early/Delayed Withdrawal
Impose penalties for early withdrawals to discourage breaking the lock-in period. Introduce bonus rewards for users who keep their stake past the maturity date.

## Testing Scenarios:
- Withdraw funds before the lock-in period ends and verify that penalties are applied correctly.
- Delay withdrawal beyond the maturity date and check that bonus rewards are accurately distributed.
- Simulate scenarios where users attempt to bypass penalties, and ensure the contract properly handles these cases.

# Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)
Issue users a token (e.g., stakedToken) representing their staked position, which can be used as collateral in other DeFi protocols while still earning staking rewards. Allow staked positions to be tradable, providing liquidity and flexibility without needing to withdraw the staked amount.

## Testing Scenarios:
- Stake tokens and verify that the corresponding liquid staking token (LST) is issued.
- Test using the LST as collateral in a DeFi lending platform while ensuring staking rewards continue to accrue.
- Simulate trading of the LST and verify that ownership transfers smoothly while maintaining staked rewards.

# Customizable Pool Rewards
Allow pool creators to customize the type of rewards distributed, including tokens or project-specific perks. Add a referral system where users can earn additional rewards by referring others to stake in their pool.

## Testing Scenarios:
- Create pools with various types of rewards (e.g., different tokens) and verify that the rewards are correctly distributed to stakers.
- Test the referral system by referring users to pools and confirming that referral bonuses are accurately tracked and rewarded.
- Ensure that customizable rewards can be configured at pool creation and are distributed according to predefined rules.

# DeFi and Cross-Platform Integration
Allow integration with other DeFi platforms so users can utilize their staked assets as collateral for loans or other yield-earning opportunities. Explore cross-chain staking to allow users to stake tokens from other chains like Polkadot or Solana.

## Testing Scenarios:
- Integrate with a DeFi lending platform and test the functionality of using staked assets as collateral while ensuring staking rewards continue to accumulate.
- Simulate cross-chain staking by staking assets from other blockchains and ensuring proper staking reward distribution and liquidity functionality.
- Test staking assets on other chains and confirm that rewards and staking terms remain accurate across platforms.

# Transparency and Analytics
Provide users with real-time data on staking pool performance, potential earnings, and trends. Offer detailed analytics on how rewards are calculated and distributed, fostering transparency and trust.

## Testing Scenarios:
- Display real-time performance metrics for each staking pool and verify that the data reflects actual staking activities and rewards.
- Test the analytics feature by calculating expected rewards manually and comparing them with the figures displayed on the platform.
- Ensure that users can view transparent reward distribution records and understand how rewards are calculated for their stake.

# Emergency Withdrawal Mechanism
Implement an emergency withdrawal function with proper penalties to ensure users can retrieve funds under special circumstances like smart contract upgrades or market crashes.

## Testing Scenarios:
- Trigger emergency withdrawal scenarios and verify that funds can be withdrawn, albeit with penalties.
- Test contract upgrades or external failures to ensure emergency withdrawals work as expected, protecting users' funds.
- Confirm that emergency withdrawal penalties are applied fairly and transparently, following predefined rules.
